An Android weather application implemented using the MVVM pattern, Retrofit2, Dagger Hilt, LiveData, ViewModel, Coroutines, Room, Navigation Components, Data Binding and some other libraries from the [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) . Instant Weather fetches data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to provide real time weather information. It also makes use of the [Algolia Instant Search](https://www.algolia.com/products/instantsearch/) service which enables you search for weather conditions of various locations.
